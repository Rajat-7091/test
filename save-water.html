    <h1 >SAVE WATER SAVE LIFE</h1>
    <h3 class="subheading">INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; ">
        Water conservation includes all the policies,
        strategies and activities to sustainably manage the natural resource of fresh water, 
        to protect the hydrosphere, and to meet the current and future human demand. 
        Population, household size and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used.  
    </p>
    <div>Before we discuss about water saveing we must talk about why we need to save water.</div>
    <h3 style="color: darkred;" class="subheading">WHY SAVE WATER?</h3>
    <p>Clean, fresh water is a limited resource. With all the severe droughts happening in the world, the limited supply of fresh water is becoming one of our most precious resources. Every person on earth needs water to survive. Without it, many of us would get sick and even result in death.

        While almost 70% of the Earth is made up of water, many parts of the world suffer from clean water shortage. Conserving water is important because it keeps water pure and clean while protecting the environment.
        
        Conserving water means using our water supply wisely and be responsible. As every individual depends on water for livelihood, we must learn how to keep our limited supply of water pure and away from pollution. Keeping our water supply safe and pure will protect the water for the generations to come.
        
        Many believe that our water supply infinite. However, our supply is quite the opposite. It is important that we must not pollute your water as many do not realize just how important and scarce water is. Only 2% of the Earth’s fresh supply of water is locked in ice caps and glaciers, while 97,5% of the earth’s water is saltwater.
        
        Conserving water involves refraining from water pollution. This requires the use of strategies that includes reducing wastage, prevent damaging water quality, and improve water management. The population must save the water he has today and provide a sufficient supply for the next coming years.
        
    <p style="color: darkblue;font-weight: 700;"> Here are the reasons why saving water is important:</p>
    <div>The uses are endless:-</div>
    <P>We use water every day of our lives. It is required in almost everything we do.
        We need water for drinking, bathing, cooking, washing, and other countless activities.
        Bottom line: we need water for activities and habits we use regularly. 
        If we want to continue to keep our bodies healthy, clean, and everything else – we must conserve water.</P>
    <div>It protects our ecosystem and wildlife:-</div>
    <p>Humans are not the only species on Earth that requires water for survival. In fact, every species on this planet needs water to live and survive. Without water, the aquatic life will stand no chance of survival. 
        It is highly important that we save water that is essential to our sustainability.</p>
    <div>Water supply is already limited:-</div>
    <P>Currently, fresh water is already limited as it is.
        Out of the 70% of the water that is available, only 0.03% is made up of fresh water. 
        Every day, the population beings to increase, making the already limited amount of water much less. In order to save our future of water preservation, 
        we must learn to conserve what limited resources we have.</P>
     <div>Conserving water also saves energy:-</div>    
    <p>Pumping water from the central facility requires high amounts of energy to run the equipment.
        Studies show, that in California, almost 7% of the energy that is consumed goes towards transferring water.
        Bottom line, saving water will also lead to saving energy and reduce your carbon footprint.
        We can start saving water by making smart choices at home. We should use appliances that are most water and energy efficient.
        Using simple water conservation tips can help reduce the usage of water by more than half.
        Committing to just a bit of effort can make all the difference. You will even benefit from saving water by the reduced water bills in just the first month of saving water.
        Protect our planet and conserve water.</p>
    <h3 style="color: darkred;" class="subheading">HOW CAN WE SAVE WATER?</h3>    
     <div>1. Check your toilet for leaks. </div>  
     <p>Put a few drops of food coloring in your toilet tank.
         If, without flushing, the coloring begins to appear in the bowl, you have a leak that may be
         wasting more than 100 gallons of water a day.</p> 
      <div>2. Stop using your toilet as an ashtray or wastebasket.</div>   
      <p>Every cigarette butt or tissue you
         flush away also flushes away five to seven gallons of water.</p>
      <div>3. Put a plastic bottle in your toilet tank.</div>   
      <p>Put an inch or two of sand or pebbles in the bottom of a one liter bottle to weigh it down. Fill the rest of the bottle with water and put it in your toilet tank, safely away from the operating mechanism. In an average home, the bottle may save five gallons or more of water every day without harming the efficiency of the toilet.
         If your tank is big enough, you may even be able to put in two bottles.</p>
      <div>4. Take shorter showers.</div>   
      <p>A typical shower uses five to ten gallons of water a minute.
         Limit your showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash down and rise off.</p>
      <div>5. Install water-saving shower heads or flow restrictors.</div>
      <p>Your hardware or plumbing supply store stocks inexpensive shower heads or flow restrictors that will cut your shower flow to about three gallons a minute instead of five to ten.
         They are easy to install, and your showers will still be cleansing and refreshing.</p> 
       <div>7. Turn off the water while brushing your teeth.</div> 
      <p>Fill the bottom of the sink with a few inches of warm water in which to rinse your razor.</p>  
      <div>8. Turn off the water while shaving.</div>
      <p>Fill the bottom of the sink with a few inches of warm water in which to rinse your razor.</p>
      <div>9. Check faucets and pipes for leaks.</div>
      <p>Even a small drip can waste 50 or more gallons of water a day.</p>
      <div>10. Water your lawn only when it needs it.</div>
      <p>Watering on a regular schedule doesn't allow for cool spells or rainfall which reduce the need for watering. Step on some grass. If it springs back up when you move your foot, it doesn't need water.</p>
      <div>11. Check for leaks in pipes, hoses faucets and couplings.</div> 
      <p>Leaks outside the house are easier to ignore since they don't mess up the floor or keep you awake at night. However, they can be even more wasteful than inside water leaks especially when they occur on your main water line.</p>
